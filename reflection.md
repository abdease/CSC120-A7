Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I decided to overload the sellCoffee method to be able to add espresso shots as an option to drinks. I also overloaded the moveIn method to be able to move in multiple residents at once into a house. In the library subclass, I chose to overload the addTitle method, to be able to add both the title and author of books to the collection.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found it difficult to overload the constructors at first, because I had to make sure that all of the pieces of the original constructor were included. I also learned that the location of a super() is super important. To someone taking this course in the future, I would say that it is useful to overload methods in a practical sense, because I found it helpful to think about what purposes these buildings serve in the real world, and how I could expand upon their methods.
